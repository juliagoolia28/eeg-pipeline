# Files in this folder

## Copyfile scripts
These scripts allow you to copy subject folders and data from one location to another. The _fromsubject file pulls from a subject script that states each subjects name explicitly. The _fromexcel pulls from the example subjects.xlsx file. 
The input and output folder names can be changed for corresponding directories of interest. 

## Load Datasets script
This script pulls subjects from the example subjects.xlsx file and loads their corresponding EEG dataset. The name of the dataset and corresponding directory location must be modified. 
If a subject is wrong, the 1 (of 1:length) can be modified to change where you are in the list of subjects in the excel file.
